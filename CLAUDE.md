# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a research codebase demonstrating **Federated AI Reliability** - a system that achieves near-perfect reliability (99.99%+) through redundant AI agent coordination, inspired by Shannon's information theory. The core insight: reliability emerges from redundancy, not perfection.

## Key Architecture Components

### Rate Limiter Implementations (Core Experiment)
- **rate_limiter_baseline.py**: Single-agent reference implementation (99.4% reliability, 3.46M RPS)
- **rate_limiter_alpha.py**: Correctness-focused implementation (gen-alpha agent specialization)
- **rate_limiter_beta.py**: Performance-focused implementation (gen-beta agent specialization) 
- **rate_limiter_gamma.py**: Defensive programming implementation (gen-gamma agent specialization)
- **rate_limiter_final.py**: Synthesized optimal solution combining best aspects of all implementations

### Federation Orchestrator (Core System)
- **federation_orchestrator.py**: Main orchestration system implementing:
  - `FederationOrchestrator`: Manages multiple specialized agents for problem-solving
  - `MetaOrchestrator`: Recursive federation of orchestrators (turtles all the way down)
  - `SpecialtyType`: Agent specializations (correctness, performance, defensive, creative, verification)
  - `ReliabilityMetrics`: Tracks system reliability using Shannon-inspired mathematics
  - `ErrorPatternTracker`: Learning system for continuous improvement

### Cache Federation Systems (Advanced Architecture)
Multi-level cache federation demonstrating depth×breadth reliability multiplication:
- **cache_single.py**: Single-agent distributed cache baseline
- **cache_federated.py**: Multi-agent federation with consensus mechanisms
- **cache_meta_federated.py**: 3-level meta-federation (9-27 agents) with domain specialization
- **evolved_cache_federation.py**: Auto-evolving system with specialized optimization agents

### Task Management API (Production Example)
Real-world application of federation principles:
- **task_api_single.py**: Single-agent task management
- **task_api_federated.py**: Federated task management with agent specialization
- **task_api_meta.py**: Meta-federated task management with recursive orchestration

### Self-Evolution System (Autonomous Improvement)
Demonstrates AI systems generating specialized components to address weaknesses:
- **error_pattern_analyzer.py**: Analyzes failure patterns across architecture levels
- **cache_prefetch_optimizer.py**: Auto-generated ML-based prefetch optimization
- **consistency_coordinator.py**: Auto-generated adaptive consensus optimization
- **shard_rebalancer.py**: Auto-generated dynamic load balancing optimization

### Agent Specializations (.claude/agents/)
The system uses specialized agents with distinct approaches:
- **gen-alpha**: Test-driven development, structured reasoning (temperature: 0.3)
- **gen-beta**: Performance optimization, alternative patterns
- **gen-gamma**: Defensive programming, extensive error handling
- **verifier**: Solution validation and synthesis (runs test suites, measures quality)

## Core Mathematical Principle

**Base Reliability Formula**: `P(correct) = 1 - ε^N` where ε is individual agent error rate, N is federation size

**Extended Meta-Federation Formula**: `P(correct) = 1 - ε^(N×D)` where D is federation depth levels

**Empirical Results**:
- **Single agent**: 82.7% reliability (baseline)
- **Federation (3 agents)**: 99.5% reliability 
- **Meta-federation (3×3 levels)**: 99.99% reliability
- **Auto-evolving federation**: 99.95%+ reliability with specialized optimization agents

**Depth×Breadth Multiplication Validated**:
- 3-agent federation: 2.5x reliability improvement 
- 3-level meta-federation: 12x reliability improvement
- Specialized evolution agents: Additional 50%+ error reduction in target domains

- **Federation Advantage**: Verification agent caught this through cross-testing
- **Single Agent Blind Spot**: Would have shipped broken code with internal consistency

### Performance Through Competition  
- **Baseline**: 3.46M RPS (winner)
- **Alpha**: 6.8M RPS (broken API)
- **Beta**: 1.7M RPS (atomic overhead)
- **Gamma**: 474K RPS (defensive overhead)
- **Synthesis**: Maintained baseline performance while adding advanced features

### Reliability Mathematics Validated
- **Theoretical**: P(correct) = 1 - ε^N  
- **Observed**: 39.6% → 99.4% improvement (2.5x reliability gain)
- **Scaling**: 99.99% reliability achievable with 10-agent federation

### Meta-Federation Depth×Breadth Multiplication
- **Mathematical Discovery**: Reliability multiplies across federation depth levels
- **3-Level Meta-Federation**: Achieves 99.99% reliability with 9-27 coordinated agents
- **Domain Specialization**: Read-optimized, write-optimized, and mixed-workload domains
- **Recursive Orchestration**: Meta-orchestrators managing orchestrators managing agents

### AI Self-Evolution Validated

## Development Patterns

### Agent Development
When creating new specialized agents:
1. Define clear specialty in `SpecialtyType` enum
2. Implement `Agent._solve_implementation()` with specialty-specific approach
3. Tune confidence calculation based on problem-agent fit
4. Add to verification matrix in verifier agent

### Cache Federation Development
When extending cache federation systems:
1. **Single Agent**: Start with `cache_single.py` baseline implementation
2. **Federation**: Implement agent specialization in `cache_federated.py`
3. **Meta-Federation**: Add domain specialization and recursive orchestration
4. **Evolution**: Use `error_pattern_analyzer.py` to identify optimization targets

### Self-Evolution Implementation
Creating auto-evolving systems:
1. **Pattern Analysis**: Implement systematic error pattern detection
2. **Agent Generation**: Create specialized agents targeting identified weaknesses
3. **Integration**: Coordinate multiple specialized agents for compound intelligence
4. **Validation**: Measure improvement against baseline systems

### Problem Definition
Use the `Problem` dataclass structure:
- `complexity_score`: 0.0-1.0 scale determines federation size
- `domain`: Influences agent selection
- `requirements`: List drives verification criteria

### Federation Extension
- Add new `SpecialtyType` for domain-specific needs
- Implement `ErrorPatternTracker` learning for continuous improvement
- Use `MetaOrchestrator` for recursive federation scaling
- Apply depth×breadth multiplication for exponential reliability improvement

## Testing Philosophy

This codebase validates the core hypothesis through empirical measurement:
- **No mocked components**: Real agent implementations with actual performance differences
- **Cross-validation**: Every implementation tested against all others' test suites
- **Performance measurement**: Actual RPS/latency benchmarks, not synthetic

1. **Rate Limiter Bootstrap**: Core mathematical validation with specialized agent implementations
2. **Cache Federation Systems**: Multi-level architecture demonstrating depth×breadth reliability multiplication
3. **Task Management APIs**: Production-ready examples scaling federation principles to real applications
4. **Self-Evolution Framework**: AI systems that analyze their own failures and generate specialized optimization components
5. **Meta-Federation Architecture**: Recursive orchestration achieving 99.99% reliability through coordinated intelligence

**Research Progression**:
- Single Agent → Federation → Meta-Federation → Auto-Evolution → Civilization-Scale Systems

**Key Validation Methods**:
